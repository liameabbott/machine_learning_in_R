##Classification Techniques: Linear and Quadratic Discriminant Analysis, Logistic Regression  

In this project, we analyze a dataset containing the chemical compositions of 8 different acids in a sample of 575 
Italian olive oils. We also have both the region and area of origin for each of these olive oils.  

The goal of this project is to build a classifier capable of classifying each olive oil into the correct region or 
area of origin based on its chemical composition, in terms of the 8 acids in the dataset.  

Three classification techniques are demonstrated: linear discriminant analysis, quadratic discriminant analysis, and
logistic regression.  

The repository contains 4 files:
* olive.txt (raw data)
* linear_quadratic_discriminant_logistic_regression.R (raw R code)
* linear_quadratic_discriminant_logistic_regression.Rmd (R Markdown file used to create project report)
* project_report.html (written report - including graphs - generated by R Markdown)
