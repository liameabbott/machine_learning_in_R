##Factor Analysis and Multidimensional Scaling

In this project, we analyze a dataset containing 13 variables corresponding to the content of different chemicals 
in a sample of 180 different wines. 

The primary goal of this project is reducing the dimension of the dataset using the techniques of factor analysis 
and multidimensional scaling

The repository contains 4 files:
* wine.txt (raw data)
* factor_analysis_and_multidimensional_scaling.R (raw R code)
* factor_analysis_and_multidimensional_scaling.Rmd (R Markdown file used to create project report)
* project_report.html (written report - including graphs - generated by R Markdown)
