##Classification Techniques: k-Nearest Neighbors, Trees, Random Forests, Adaboost, Support Vector Machines    

In this project, we analyze a dataset containing the chemical compositions of 8 different acids in a sample of 575 
Italian olive oils. We also have the region of origin for each of these olive oils.  

The goal of this project is to build a classifier capable of classifying each olive oil into the correct region of 
origin based on its chemical composition, in terms of the 8 acids in the dataset.  

Five different classification techniques are demonstrated: k-nearest neighbors, trees, random forests, adaboost, and
support vector machines.

The repository contains 4 files:
* olive.txt (raw data)
* knn_trees_forests_adaboost_svm.R (raw R code)
* knn_trees_forests_adaboost_svm.Rmd (R Markdown file used to create project report)
* project_report.html (written report - including graphs - generated by R Markdown)
