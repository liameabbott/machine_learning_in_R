##Principal Components Analysis

In this project, we analyze a dataset containing 13 variables corresponding to the content of different chemicals 
in a sample of 180 different wines. 

The primary goal of this project is reducing the dimension of the dataset using the technique of principal 
components analysis.

The repository contains 4 files:
* wine.txt (raw data)
* principal_components_analysis.R (raw R code)
* principal_components_analysis.Rmd (R Markdown file used to create project report)
* project_report.html (written report - including graphs - generated by R Markdown)
